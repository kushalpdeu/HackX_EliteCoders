# Health Experience Platform

## Problem Statement
Many individuals face minor but urgent health issues that may not require immediate doctor consultation. Yet, reliable, relatable, and practical solutions are difficult to find online. Users often hesitate to discuss such issues publicly due to privacy concerns, leading to missed insights from othersâ€™ real-life experiences.

## Solution Overview
The Health Experience Platform is a web-based, community-driven application that allows users to share and discover real health experiences anonymously. It bridges the gap between those in need of relatable health insights and those who have recovered from similar conditions, offering authentic experiences over prescriptions.

### Core Features
- Anonymous experience sharing with structured inputs (disease, symptoms, medications, recovery time, and story)
- Tag-based search algorithm for efficient experience discovery
- Internal anonymous messaging system for follow-up interactions
- Verified experience badges for trusted information
- Reward model to encourage authentic contributions

## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
Backend: Python (Flask or Django)  
Database: MySQL  
Search Engine: Tag-based similarity matching system

## Usage
1. Share an Experience: Fill out a simple, secure form containing disease name, symptoms, recovery time, medication used, doctor consultation details, and a personal story.  
2. Find an Experience: Search by disease or symptoms. The platform returns Experience Cards with a summary, allowing users to read in detail or send anonymous messages.  
3. Earn and Support: Users seeking experiences pay a nominal fee (â‚¹150). Contributors whose experiences help others earn a â‚¹75 reward, ensuring a sustainable and participatory ecosystem.

## Impact
- Promotes peer-to-peer health awareness and self-education  
- Reduces unnecessary doctor visits  
- Builds a credible, community-driven health experience database  
- Encourages open yet private health discussions

## Feasibility
Technical: Uses lightweight, open-source technologies that support scalability.  
Human: Designed for a simple, intuitive user experience across all age groups.  
Financial: Self-sustaining through low institutional and hosting costs.

## Vision
To create a safe, anonymous community where individuals empower one another through authentic, experience-based health stories â€” a trusted space for learning, sharing, and healing together.
