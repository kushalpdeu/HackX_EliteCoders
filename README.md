Problem Statement: Many individuals face minor but urgent health issues that don’t always require a doctor’s consultation. However, reliable and relatable solutions are often unavailable online, and users hesitate to discuss such problems publicly due to privacy concerns.

Share Their Experience by submitting a structured form containing:

Find an Experience by searching for diseases or symptoms. The system matches relevant entries and displays them as “Experience Cards” with a brief summary and an option to read full details or send a message anonymously.
