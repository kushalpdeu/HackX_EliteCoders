# ü©∫ HackX_EliteCoders ‚Äì Health Experience Platform

**A secure, anonymous, and community-driven platform for sharing and finding relatable health recovery experiences.**

---

## ‚ú® About The Project

Many individuals encounter **minor, urgent health concerns** that do not necessarily require immediate medical consultation. Current online resources often lack the **relatable, peer-to-peer perspective** needed for self-education. Furthermore, users often hesitate to discuss sensitive issues publicly due to **privacy concerns**.

The **Health Experience Platform** addresses this by creating a structured and anonymous space for sharing and accessing verified recovery stories, promoting community wellness and reducing unnecessary clinical visits.

### Key Features

* **Anonymous Sharing:** Users can submit detailed recovery experiences via a structured form (Disease Name, Symptoms, Recovery Time, Medications, Consultation Status, and Personal Story).
* **Structured Search:** Users can efficiently search for experiences based on diseases or symptoms.
* **Experience Cards:** Search results are displayed as concise cards with brief summaries and options to view full details or send an anonymous follow-up message.
* **Peer-to-Peer Support:** Promotes community-driven wellness, awareness, and self-education.
* **Data Insight:** Builds a growing, real-world database of relatable health experiences.
